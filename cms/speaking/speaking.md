## Speak at PyCon

The PyCon 2017 Call for Proposals is open!

* Tutorial proposals — deadline is 30 November 2016.

* Talk, Poster, and Education Summit proposals — deadline is 3 January 2017.

Part of PyCon’s purpose is to generate materials to help with Python education and advocacy all over the world, so we intend to record all PyCon presentations and release the recordings on the web. For the details, see our PyCon Recording Release.

## Where to submit your proposal

1. Sign up for a new us.pycon.org account, or sign in to an account that you created previously:

  https://us.pycon.org/2017/account/signup/

  OR

2. Head over to your dashboard and create a Speaker profile:

3. Finally, return to your dashboard and you should see our “Submit a new proposal” button!

Due to the competitive selection process, we encourage prospective speakers to submit their proposals as early as possible.

## Guidelines for Proposal Submission

Everyone who is interested is encouraged to submit a proposal, regardless of experience level. PyCon thrives on having talks ranging from introductory to advanced. If you are reading this, and you are interested in speaking at PyCon, we want you to submit a proposal.

Before writing up a proposal, read the following descriptions of the three kinds of presentation at PyCon — Talks, Tutorials, and Posters — and follow the “Learn more” links for the kind that best suits your topic.

### Talks

These are the traditional talk sessions given during the main conference days, Friday through Sunday, May 19–May 21.

Most talks are 30 minutes long, but we do offer a limited number of 45-minute slots for important topics that promise to benefit from a more extensive treatment. We organize the schedule into five "tracks", grouping talks by topic and having them in the same room for consecutive sessions.

There is no official restriction on the topic that you propose for a talk session. Talks about Python or the Python community are most likely to line up with the interests of PyCon's audience, and a key consideration that the talk selection committee will be thinking about is your talk’s ability to draw an audience. We observe a limit of one talk per presenter. You may propose more than one, but the committee will ask you to choose only one talk if more than one of your proposals is accepted.

### Tutorials

As with the talks, we are looking for tutorials that can grow this community at any level. We aim for tutorials that will advance Python, advance this community, and shape the future. Each tutorial session runs for 3 full hours plus a break for coffee. There is both a morning tutorial session and an afternoon tutorial session on the two days preceding the main conference — this year, the tutorial days are Wednesday and Thursday, May 17–18 in the same venue that hosts the main conference days that follow.

Attention full-time trainers: Please bring your course work to PyCon. Every year we get several educators to bring their show on the road, so show us what you have on the syllabus for 2017.

As tutorials are longer than talks and are in an interactive classroom-like setting, they require much more preparation. Due to the amount of work involved, tutorial instructors are compensated. There is a limit of at most two tutorials given by one presenter.

Posters

The poster session happens on the last morning of the three main conference days — this year, on the morning of Sunday, May 21 in the same space that is occupied by the sponsor Expo Hall on the first two days of the conference.

A poster is a presentation of a topic on a 4′×8′ poster board. As attendees mingle through the rows, they find interesting topics, read through them, then strike up a discussion. As with the other proposal types, we are really looking to you to talk about what's going on in this community and tell everyone where it is going. If you are doing something awesome, share it!

Education Summit

The Education Summit happens on the last day of tutorials, May 18, 2017.

We are looking for calls to action about how teachers and Python programmers have implemented Python instruction in their schools, communities, and other places of learning. Have you implemented a program that you've been dying to talk about? Have you tried something that failed but learned some great lessons that you can share? Have you been successful implementing a particular program? Then we urge you to submit a talk! You do NOT need to be an experienced speaker! We want you to share knowledge; we want to learn from your experiences. This year, talks that focus on the challenges and triumphs of implementing code education are especially encouraged. Please submit all talk proposals through your dashboard.
