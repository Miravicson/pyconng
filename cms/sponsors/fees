## Estimated Sponsor Fees

We heard from several sponsors at PyCon 2016 that we should be more transparent with the fees that come with having a booth. We are aiming to make PyCon a great experience for sponsors! For 2017, PyCon is paying for everyone's power. This will be a standard power setup: 5 amp/500 watt outlet.

Below is a breakdown of possible charges a sponsor may see if they ship swag bag inserts and/or have a booth. Please note that these are 2016 prices and that 2017 prices may be different. We will update these prices with current fees once they are negotiated.

* Power: 5 amp/500 watt outlet included

* Shipping: Sponsors are responsible for shipping charges to and from the conference. Cost depend on carrier and location. Please use GES's online form to request a quote for domestic or international shipping logistics. This will give you a good idea regarding all the costs that are included in shipping to the advance warehouse and/or direct to the convention center.

* Material Handling: If you choose to ship your items to the advanced warehouse or directly to the convention center, a handling fee will be applied. Handling charges to receive small packages start at $25.25. Handling charges for crated material (on a skid or pallet) start at $98.50 per 100 lbs. It is more economical to ship this way, rather than ship individual boxes.

* **[Optional]** Material storage: Please request a quote from GES if you have extra items that you will need to bring out (t-shirts or other giveaways) that you don't have room for in your booth.

* Wifi: standard conference wifi is included - Up to 2Mbps for 1 device.

  * **[Optional]** Your own wifi network: Prices range from a "run of show" (all three days) of $880 to $2,640, depending on the number of devices and Mbps (early bird pricing).

* **[Optional]** Carpet : Having a carpet and pad is a nice addition to your booth, and provides a comfortable surface for your staff and attendees to stand on. Pre-cut carpets range from $176 (early bird pricing) for a 10x10 booth, to $345 for a 10 x 20 booth. Carpet pad is $1.31 per sq. ft. (early bird pricing). Package pricing is available in the exhibitors manual.

* **[Optional]** Booth cleaning: Vacuuming a 10x10 booth is $36/day; 10x20 is $62/day (early bird pricing). You can also bring your own vacuum and do it yourself.
