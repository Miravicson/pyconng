PyCon is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. PyCon is organized by the Python community for the community. We try to keep registration far cheaper than most comparable technology conferences in order to keep PyCon accessible to the widest group possible. The conference draws a diverse delegation for which we are dedicated to providing an enjoyable experience to everyone.

Your sponsorship helps keep PyCon affordable and accessible to the widest possible audience. PyCon is organized by volunteers from the Python community and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, a 501(c)3 charitable organization set up to manage the growth and development of Python worldwide.

Benefits of sponsorship:

* Show support of the Python Community
* Thought leadership
* Brand awareness and recognition by showcasing products, services, and technologies
* Targeted marketing opportunities
* Talent acquisition and recruitment
* Generate new partnerships, alliances, and customers

The available sponsorships are below. Depending on your level of sponsorship, packages include complimentary conference passes, booth space, lead retrieval scanners, speaking opportunities, participation in the Job Fair, and Plenary Room branding.

**Python Software Foundation Sponsors (Diamond, Platinum, Gold, and Silver) receive additional tickets to PyCon. Please inquire for details.**
